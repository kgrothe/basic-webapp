the project directory with ‘npm install’ command.

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
Use vue.js development tools while project is in development to test and debug in browser using 
‘npm run dev’ command.

# build for production with minification
Minify and uglify code with build command before deploying using ‘npm run build’ command.

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
Process code to produce visualization of components of the webpage in the browser as well as a written 
report of the components and their sizes in the code editor using ‘npm run build –report’ command.
